Over Time the delta value changes however it generally hovers around between -26 and -29
		Need some sort of stabilization mechanism



Adaptive thresholding:
	Take N measurements and take average and dependant of how often there are changes to the value


Pygame Notes:

we get a list of events from pygame so we have to go through them with a for loop

A Display surface is the canvas that gets drawn on
    there can only be one display surface

A surface is an image
    unlimited
    requires a display surface

blit : block image treansfer
    display_surface.blit(surface,position)
    top left position


Rectangle created from the surface


surf=Pygame.image.load('path')
rect=surf.get_rect(rect_pos)
inside the blit you essentially map the surface to the rectangle



delta time: we are trying to essentially map the events to time instead of frames just so we could basically have a more stable functionality on all possible platforms
where for example if a bullet would be shot its position wouldn't be changed per frame but per time


Determine: 

Speed(pixels per frame)				Frames per second			Delta Time (1/Frames Per second)		Original Movement (Per Second)				Delta Movement (per second)
10										30							1/30								10*30=300									10*30*1/30=10

clock.tick returns how long it takes to draw a frame
